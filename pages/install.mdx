# Installing üWave

> **Warning!** Not everything described on this page is ready just yet.

This page describes how to install üWave from scratch using the [üWave CLI](/cli).
This is aimed at a production environment—for a development installation, check out the [üWave Web Client](/web) documentation.
If you run into trouble, try visiting the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/u-wave/Lobby) chat room!

## Dependencies

To run üWave, you need a server with:

* Node.js
* MongoDB - [Install instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
* Redis

### Ubuntu 20.04

On Ubuntu 20.04, the following commands will install everything we need:

```bash
echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential mongodb-org nodejs redis-server
```

## Install

> **TODO** This should be rewritten to use systemd instead.

We will use the `pm2` tool to manage the üWave server process and logging, and we will use the üWave CLI to configure the server.

With `npm` do:

```bash
npm install --global pm2 u-wave-cli
```

Next, we will install the `logrotate` module for `pm2`, which automatically archives log files by date.
That way log files don't grow to many hundreds of MBs.

```bash
pm2 install pm2-logrotate
```

> **TODO** This should be written when the new server and web client alphas are released.

Now we will start the configuration of the üWave server itself.
The CLI will ask some questions about the necessary databases, API keys and administrator account credentials.

```bash
u-wave init
```
